## 1. Support Civil Liberties Online and Off

Donald Trump hasn't said anything about technology or privacy. It's impossible to know what his agenda will be regarding our lives online and the security of our data and communications.

What we do know is that he aggressively pursues and prosecutes dissenters. He disregards freedom of expression in favor of demonizing and silencing those who disagree. So since I happen to be a dissenter, this is of particular concern.

My first contributions today were to the [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/) and the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/). The [ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/) is monitoring Trump to make sure that he doesn't act on any of his unconstitutional plans. They have promised to litigate if he tries to move forward with any executive overreach. And since he doesn't seem to know what is within his purview as president, I'm sure that will happen soon. [Here's a list of some of his proposals which violate constitutional law.](https://medium.com/acluelection2016/donald-trump-a-one-man-constitutional-crisis-9f7345e9d376#.40fb4e7ty)
#### "According to our analysis, Trumpâ€™s proposals taken together would violate the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments to the Constitution.

[EFF](https://www.eff.org/) is "leading the fight against NSA's illegal mass surveillance program". Illegal government surveillance has expanded under Obama, and Trump will inherit that massive spying apparatus. The work of the EFF is more important than ever.

## 2. Do What I Can

I scheduled a workshop to talk about online privacy with my staff at the office. This is the email I wrote them:
#### "In light of recent political events, I find myself thinking strategically about how to ensure my online privacy. I spent some time today getting my communications and online activity in order. It occurred to me that some of you might also be interested in how best to protect yourself and ensure the privacy of your online activity and communication. I'll be doing a short workshop on Wednesday morning next week on 1) the level of privacy of your communications here, and 2) what you can do to protect your private communications and activity as well."

It's important to take steps to educate those around us and help where we can. I am reaching out to those around me to help, letting people of color and those marginalized know that I stand with them. And using any skill sets or knowledge I have to make things better, even a little bit.

## 3. Protest

I stand for caring, kindness, openness, human rights, understanding, and acceptance. Most importantly, I stand with the oppressed against the oppressor.

Today, I am motivated to live my life in protest to the values that won today. I protest ignorance. I protest cruelty and I protest fear.

I want to live a life that openly rebukes the doctrine of fear and hate, and today I am ever firmer in my resolve to love and care and fight for my brothers and sisters.
