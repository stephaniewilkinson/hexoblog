## The World Harp
We just got back from a concert featuring an instrument called the World Harp. A group of artists and technicians travel around the world and have concerts featuring this harp.

## Building the harp

Tonight, they had constructed it from the base on the ground, to the bridge at the top of a skyscraper. The harp strings were literally strung to the top of the building. The assist stood on the bridge of the harp and played by rubbing the cables with gloves.

## How the harp works

Walking through downtown on our way to the concert was a trip. You could hear the harp music reverberating through the city for blocks away. It was amazing! I wish they played every night.
