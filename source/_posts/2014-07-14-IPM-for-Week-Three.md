# IPM for Week Three

On Monday, Pat, Stephanie, Wale, Josh, Rob, and Jalil met with Pivots Mike and Ryan for our Week Three IPM. We planned out what stories would get done this week, along with a short recap of highs and lows from last week.

While reviewing last week, a few issues came to light. On the positive side, we were excited to have new team members, great coaching, and happy to be making progress. On the negative side, there were some questions about mobbing chaos, vim customization, and clarity of direction from the Pivots.

Pat's idea was to create a vanilla .vimrc that we can add to our virtual box. That way whenever we are using our virtual machine, we'll all have the same vim configuration.

Another idea was to create a mobbing manual. In our early discussion, we laid out some roles, rules and values for our mobbing experience. Later in the night, with the Pivots, we tweaked it with some new ideas. Read our [Manual of Mob](https://gist.github.com/).

Then we moved on to the next story in our PivotalTracker, which was creating an acceptance environment. We had been battling a heroku postgres error on Thursday night that hadn't got resolved. The error was preventing us from pushing to Heroku. We installed psql on our Ubuntu vagrantbox, which cleared up the error and allowed us to push. We clicked "finish" on that story.

The last thing we worked on was researching ripl, a REPL. There is a lot we don't know about the ripl app, and we created four stories related to researching how it works and what it can do. The week before, we had run ripl's tests, which passed, but we need to make sure it will work for our project.
