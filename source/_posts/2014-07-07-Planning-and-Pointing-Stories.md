# Day 4 - Planning and Pointing Stories

After creating stories last week, today was the day to give the stories points. Wale, Jen and Stephanie (with Josh on a Google Hangout) met with Pivots Ryan and Mike to evaluate and plan our stories.

We used Fibonacci numbers, 1, 3, 5, 8 to assign value to the stories. Pivot Ryan explained that pointing stories is not about determining the time it takes to complete the story, but the complexity. Rote tasks, even if they are time consuming, should have low point values.

Often, when pointing stories, teams will disagree over the point values. Two things can be done when this happens. First, you should discuss the story to make sure there are no hidden challenges, and everyone is on the same page about the scope. Second, try to break the story into smaller stories with fewer points.

We proceeded to assign points to all our stories. We found they tended to clump into three major point values.

&#149; One point stories had to do with writing copy, which we did not see as complex.

&#149; Three point stories included writing methods, and evaluating user code input

&#149; Five point stories included building a functioning REPL, the most complex task

We are going to plan for one week sprints, with a velocity of ten. Velocity refers to how many points you can complete over a period of time. After we discussed and pointed the stories, we entered them into our Pivotal Tracker, to begin work tomorrow.
