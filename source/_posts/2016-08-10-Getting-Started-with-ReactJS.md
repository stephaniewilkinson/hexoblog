# Wonderful world of ReactJS



Last night, [Ruby in Hollywood](https://twitter.com/rubyinhollywood) held a [special event](www.meetup.com/rubyinhollywood/events/232566071/) in conjunction with the [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly) Alumni Guild.

We had a great mix of aspiring and current Rubyists, along with a good representation of General Assembly Grads from Cohort 9.

We kicked off the evening with pizza and beer, and some good conversation.

##HTTP in Rubyland

Then [Shannon Skipper](https://twitter.com/_havenn), Lead Engineer at The Industry, took the stage. He walked us through the difference between various rack webservers and made a convincing argument for using [Roda](http://roda.jeremyevans.net/) for a ruby framework that is quick, light, and handles requests efficiently.
