# How I Created a Capsule Wardrobe

## Part 2: Casual Clothes

After [creating a work wardrobe capsule](http://), the next day I was ready to tackle the rest of my closet. Having had good luck with the Capsule app, I decided to try Cladwell's other app, Outfits. I was a little disappointed that they didn't share a database, and I had to enter all my clothes again.

There were about a half dozen pieces of mine that I couldn't find in the app. Halters, crops, bodysuits, and overalls. They reached out to me and asked whether there was anything I couldn't find, so I gave them that list. I think maybe being young and living in LA, I wear more summerish clothes than their usual user, but they said they'd be able to add all of them, with the exception of bodysuits.

### The Outfits App

The concept of Outfits is that it will recommend three outfits a day for you to wear. I really got behind their philosophy of buying less, and shopping your closet first.

On the first day, they recommended I wear a graphic tee over a green shiny pleated dress, with Keds. I would never have thought of that combo! I gave it a try, and it was great. The dress was on the expensive side, so I had only worn it a couple times, but pairing it with a shirt overtop gave it new life. There's another app called [?](http) that actually calculates the cost per wear of your items. You tell it how much you paid and it keeps track of the cost per wear declining as you wear it.

In my opinion, Outfits is a great app, but of course there's a lot I would change about it. I normally wear at least two outfits per day, one for work and one for going out at night, and it only lets you log one per day.

### Moving Forward

Cladwell only supports and recommends clothing companies which are slave-free and free-trade, which cuts out most of the clothing industry. I completely support that stance and I shop all second hand.

A nice feature of the app is that it tells you what pieces you could get to round out your wardrobe. It shows you the new outfits you could create with what you already own, plus the new piece. I took my iPad to the secondhand store with me to see if I could get any of the pieces it recommended.

### Old Habits

What was interesting is that in the store shopping, I kept gravitating to the things I already had. I really like silk blouses, and kept grabbing those to try on. Having the app there reminded me that I already had two of those, and should really branch out for a more well rounded wardrobe.

#### Keeping Momentum

Moving forward, I'm going to be much more conscientous about buying clothes. I really want to limit my consumption as much as possible. And when I do buy something, it will be something that is secondhand and adds more options to my wardrobe. All in all, I feel like dressing up is much more fun and creative with a little bit of structure in place. Once my morning outfit is recommended to me, my only job is to accessorize, and that's so much fun.
