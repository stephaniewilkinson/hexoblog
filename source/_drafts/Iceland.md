May Edition

I'm writing this from the BART in San Francisco. Tomorrow, I attend a brief workshop on Institutional Research in Independent Schools. I always find SF to be so energizing--it's like, even landing in SFO feels exciting to me. For some reason, it seems like this is a city full of people like me. Seeing billboards in the airport for companies I've worked with, or interned for, or whose products I use makes me feel oddly at home.

The biggest thing that happened this month was our trip to Iceland for my 30th birthday!
