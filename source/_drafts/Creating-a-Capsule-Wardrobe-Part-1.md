# How I Created a Capsule Wardrobe

## Part 1: Work Clothes

## Getting Started

After hearing the buzz about `The Lifechanging Magic of Tidying Up` for the last few years, I decided to skim through it last week. Marie Kondo advocates for only holding onto things which "spark joy". Since we are moving to a new apartment in a week, I thought I would take this opportunity to put her methods into practice.

My normal strategy for tidying has more of an organizational/storage thrust, which Kondo criticizes in her book. I'm used to returning belongings to matching stackable clear containers. Kondo would prefer, I think, fewer belongings kept in plain sight. Stacking containers are hard to access when you want to put things away.

I culled my closet and came up with a bag or so of clothes to recycle. A couple of the items were higher value so I listed those on eBay, and then donated the rest. That left me with roughly 100 items left in my closet.

Then I got a little technological help. I've long been fascinated with the idea of a capsule wardrobe. I started with my work clothes, since that was an easier chunk to bite off.

### Wardrobe strategy

Another wardrobe strategy I use is what I call Einstein outfits. I don't know if it's true or not, but it's reported that Einstein always wore the same thing, to save the brain power spent deciding on clothes and use it for better things. I adapted this concept. I had six complete work outfits, and would wear one per day. Then wash it, and put it at the back of the line. The next morning pull from the outfit in front, and at the end of the day wash and repeat. I chose six rather than five so my coworkers wouldn't know that Monday equals blue top and black skirt.

Since I've been doing Einstein outfits, my work wardrobe was better curated so I started there. I recycled anything that didn't fit, or I didn't feel good about wearing. Anything too tight or revealing, anything I wouldn't want to lead a meeting while wearing.

This left me with three skirts, five tops, three blazers, no pants, and three low-backed jumpsuits. That last one is a lie.

### The Capsules App

I found the Capsules app by Cladwell and started logging my pieces. It's a paid app. I have no problem with paying for apps, since I'm an app developer myself. I'd rather pay for an app than see ads, and I'm happy paying for something beautiful and useful and supporting good development.

Capsules grouped my clothes by type. It had me break my clothes out into capsules by season and use. So "Work Clothes for Summer", "Casual Winter", etc.

Technically, capsule wardrobes are supposed to be minimalist, and you're not allowed to reach outside the capsule. The orthodox method is to store other items, and to stick to your capsule. But my intention was to use capsules as a guiding principle in the Konmari way, rather than a rigid limitation to 30 pieces, like a lot of bloggers are doing. I just wanted to have capsules as a way to think about clothes, style, and wardrobe, rather than a strict procedure.

### What I logged

### End Result

After finishing, I now have the following separates to mix and match:
